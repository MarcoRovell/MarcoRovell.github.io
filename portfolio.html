                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p class="indented-text">The idea for EuroViz was first thought of back in April 2025 during a personal project which became an intense frenzy to search for important data, which led to an important thought–an application that can provide the insights and excerpts that I want to find, readily available. This would target researchers, academics, and hobbyists alike. The final product we have resembles an application which allows these users to browse data structured into various themes that shed different lights on the underlying connections between data. You can understand deeper communities by looking at network graphs, or find clusters of data on a map, or develop chronological storylines with a timeline. These can be integral for our users to create these views in real time, export them quickly for their research, and look back on previous works all from one device. 
                    The project followed a standard UX design process that began with an idea, and it morphed into something tangible by completing interviews with potential users, then creating user personas based on our interviewees and developing the sitemap. We then moved on to creating the overall app flows and key user journeys. Finally, we moved on to developing the navigation schemes, created wireframes, and landed on the app's final color schemes and design. Each step was integral to building the next. Without the design process, we might lose sight of what the user really wants, the decisions we made weeks ago that we want to include, and it gives the designer small, actionable steps to create an application design.

                <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
                <p class="indented-text">Research was completed in a variety of stages. We first probed various students within the digital humanities course to ask them their experiences with technologies similar to our product, or serves similar functions, then expand on their likes, dislikes, and what they feel could be improved. This was the core of our exploratory research, which helped us identify some key features we’d like to provide to the user. We do acknowledge the users we interviewed had varying proficiencies with the technology we were creating, and we understand the limitations of the in-class time constraints, the backgrounds of all the users, and the sample of users we were able to converse with. In the future, we might structure the interviews better, because many times we had to skip questions and/or rush ones such that the interview process would complete in the designated time frame. Needless to say, more users to interview would be substantial for the next step in the discovery phase–The User Persona. Even with the limitations in the interview  process, we identified some key, important features that we know our user persona will also want. We also have a desired/expected audience such as researchers that we want to gear the product towards. This led us to the creation of our user persona–Dr. Abbas Salimi (A real researcher of Iranian studies). His desires were reflected by the interviewees and we omitted some of the less prioritized/significant ones. This was probably one of the best aspects of our research & discovery phase, which culminated in a strong persona to build the app’s design for.  It was here where we also slightly moved away from the desired vision, prioritizing what a researcher/academic may desire from these products. Less hand-holding aside from the tutorial, a streamlined exportation pipeline with built-in citations and other valuable tools. 
                    This ended up as the bulk of the final product’s idea and design pages.

                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <p class="indented-text">	As we moved forward into the design process, we begin with the final app’s outline. Without a strong fundamental understanding of Figma, we figured hand-drawn or simple google images was sufficient for the majority of the remaining tasks. With that being said, learning to use Figma may have improved the product much more, because the sitemap and navigation scheme could use some work. It seemed rushed and it partially was due to the slow process of drawing/google images. Regardless, with a vision in mind, we were able to develop a mock direction that users would be able to follow, as well as the different pages/tools they could access. This was a sort of “first draft” which changed and developed as we moved further along in the design process. We think the user journey and user flows were able to revise the earlier mistakes and/or misjudgements we made in the beginning, which resulted in a more streamlined design, highlighting improvements in the number of pages, the ultimate goals of the user, and a run-through of the actual navigation we mocked up originally. This was extremely helpful and a powerful exercise that we had at our disposal to assure quality in the app’s early stages. This spearheaded the development of the wireframes, already having the key important pages mapped out from the previous sitemap, user journey, and the navigation scheme. We were able to brainstorm a little bit with the actual, visual design. We enjoyed this specific process a lot because it finally puts the idea onto paper, showcasing a nearly finished product. Again, some design limitations were expected because of the lack of diverse softwares and experience in the field, but we can also live with that because they were designed to just be raw sketches. In general, the actual goal was to map out the application in it’s desired format (our mobile device). Finally, the app design and color scheme was the culmination of the entire process. We have our final, refined designs that display the overall colors which should harmonize, draw attention, and look pleasing to the eye. We found ourselves debating internally the most important colors we wanted to use, and we settled on a pastel, earthy tone that both harmonizes amongst each other but isn’t afraid to contrast some of the secondary colors either. We spent a lot of time developing different pieces for the final app design and we were able to come up with some very refined, impressive designs for the main core functions of the app. If we could do this design process again, we one hundred percent would invest in some softwares such as figma for wireframing, sitemaps, and app designs. We recognized it’s powerful ability to mock up these different designs efficiently,
                     but technical expertise was lacking. What we ended up doing was still fantastic work in our opinion.
                </p>

                <h3>Reflection & Future Steps</h3>
                <p class="indented-text">I believe that in the future, I can better understand the different tools at my disposal to provide more high quality designs for the entire design process. Also, with going through a UX Design Proposal, Exploratory research, and design process, I believe I can make each step go through that much better. Just the experience alone was severely impressive and will aid me in the future when I want to develop another project with the ux design in mind. I think to highlight the best parts was my final portfolio itself, the thing you’re reading this on. I blended my programming skills in computer science with this project, applying new UX techniques to the design. I also believe that my app design had a lot of effort put into it, and I am proud of the outcome especially because it comes from my own hand. I think I tied together all the elements of the project well and expanded on some of the elements that needed work. That also implies that some of my work this quarter was less than ideal, which I can agree with. I know that my interview guide was subpar, and doesn’t really display any real insights. While it wasn’t helpful to anyone else, I did personally gain neat information from the interviews,
                    I just believe I didn’t document it well and was rushed through that process. I wish we had more time for that aspect. I think I really want to learn more about site design as a formal education on it could be very helpful in my future career. Creating things for other people (code) is going to be a large part of my future, so focusing on the best ways for other people to read, understand, and experience my work is going to be very important.

                    This project was apart of a course at UCLA, Digital Humanities 110: User Experience and Design. As apart of this class, we were tasked with creating a product that 
                    would be useful to the user with a focus on the user experience. We learned the UX Design Process which is a systematic approach to designing products that are useful to the user.
                    We learned the importance of user research and how to conduct interviews to understand the user's needs and wants. We also learned the importance of wireframing and prototyping to 
                    create a product that is useful to the user. We learned the importance of color theory and how to use it to create a product that is visually appealing to the user.
